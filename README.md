Student, Dalyell Scholar at The University of Sydney \
Developer well-versed in anything Web, Distributed Systems, DevOps, AI Agents, and Smart Contracts.

Currently working hard to open a cat cafe one day 🐈‍⬛. Oh, and I'm also:
  - Working hard to improve and advocate for open-source tooling, particularly in the areas of web 🌐, security engineering 💻, and neutral and safe AI research 🤖.
  - Studying rockets in hopes to play what little part I may have in making the dream of a platform of life for humans on Mars a reality 🚀.
