Student at the University of Sydney \
Extensive experience in web, web security, distributed systems, and TypeScript and Golang ecosystems.

I author open-source packages such as [matcha](https://github.com/abyanmajid/matcha) and [thorfinn](https://github.com/abyanmajid/thorfinn)

Beyond my main line of work, I enjoy:
- indulging in effective altruism
- writing and journalism
- learning random stuff I find cool e.g., graphics, music, philosophy, politics, etc
